After much pressure from my play testers, I have implemented multi-touch functionality to the game. You can now defeat multiple ghosts are the same time. But I found out that it made the whole game easier! Going to have to do a few tweaks all over the place to balance things out, like maybe increase each ghost's HP or maybe even make them spawn faster.
